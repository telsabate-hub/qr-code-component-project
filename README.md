## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

The CSS below helped me center the component vertically on the screen.

display: flex
flex-direction: column;
justify-content: center;
height: 100vh;
```

### Continued development

I need to learn more on semantic HTML and responsive CSS design.
